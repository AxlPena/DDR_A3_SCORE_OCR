# DDR_A3_SCORE_OCR

Using Pytesseract and OpenCV, I have created an OCR Tool to collect Player DDR data and save it to a CSV.

Script requires a 1920x1080 game video input to work.

Run script and enter player name as displayed on your Konami Eamusement account. 

And watch as player data at song results are collected and saved to a csv file. 

The program is still a bit buggy.
But don't worry working on increasing accuracy.
